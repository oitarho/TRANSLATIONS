brick factories
Stages of brick production
The main stages of brick production include:
• extraction and processing of raw materials. Clay is extracted using a percussion method. The soil is fed into special installations where it is mixed with additives. Wood shavings, which are sprinkled onto the conveyor belt in advance, help to prevent the clay from sticking to the surface. • cleaning and crushing. At this stage, large particles are removed from the raw materials. As a result of grinding, the material becomes homogeneous, similar in consistency to plasticine; • mixing. Fine grinding is achieved using roll mills. A vacuum chamber is used for deaeration and thorough mixing. The mass is fed in portions and separated manually. • At the stage of forming the future bricks, the logs are automatically divided into blanks. Thin rolling allows the blocks to be cut perfectly and provides reliable protection against splitting. • Drying and cycle compliance. Optimal air circulation is ensured for drying, which takes approximately 70 hours. • The final stage of production is firing. The bricks are loaded into trolleys and subjected to high temperatures in a kiln.

glass factories
Creation of modern production of high-quality exclusive glass containers for liquor, food, processing, wine, medical, chemical industry, as well as household purposes is one of the demanded directions. The group of companies RIM GROUP offers a fully ready for realization project of a glass factory. At the Customer's request, construction materials and necessary production equipment are provided from domestic manufacturers, as well as from EU countries and China. The peculiarities of the created production are the possibility to fulfill small orders with minimal production costs, mobility, assistance in design development and prompt production of molded tooling. This will allow to stand out favorably against the background of competitors.
Two methods are common in today's industry - the Furco method and Float.
Furco method This technology is based on the method of gradual pulling of glass melt from the glass furnace through special rollers. The continuous rolling of the glass mass results in a long web. As the melt is drawn, it enters a special chamber where it is gradually cooled by blowing heated air.


21 страница

The cooled glass strip is then cut into sheets of the required size using special glass cutting machines. The thickness of the glass sheet is adjusted by changing the speed at which the melt is pulled out of the furnace. Due to the peculiarity of manufacturing, such glass is called "pulled". Production of glass by the Furco method, despite the outdated technology, is still used today.
Method of production Float The production of sheet glass using the float method is considered more modern than the pulling technology. The name of the method comes from the English word "float" - "to float". This method was first developed by the British glass company "Pilkington". The essence of the method is the molding of glass on the surface of molten steel. Liquid glass from the melting furnace enters a bath of molten tin. Since glass is lighter than tin, it spreads on its surface and gradually solidifies. The melting point of tin is much lower than that of glass, which allows the glass sheet to be formed on its surface. The thickness of the glass is controlled by the volume of the glass melt, and the shape of the sheet is determined by the design of the bath. Today, the float method is the main and most common method of glass sheet production in the world.

elevator
Elevator construction
When choosing equipment for grain storage, you should pay attention to elevators. These structures are key in the logistics chains of the agro-industrial sector, providing opportunities not only for storing crops, but also for their subsequent preparation for sale or processing. The efficient operation of an elevator allows you to maintain the high quality of your grain.
Types:
There are various types of elevators on the market, each with its own characteristics and designed for specific purposes.
Vertical silos
Vertical silos are designed for long-term storage of large volumes of grain. They can vary in capacity from several hundred to 100,000 tons, ensuring product safety thanks to humidity and temperature control systems.
Flat-bottom silos
Flat warehouses are often used for temporary storage of crops during preparation for transport or sale. These structures are easier to adapt to different volumes and are usually cheaper, but require more land for installation.
Feed mills
Feed mills are enterprises specializing in the production of compound feed, which are mixtures of various feed components (grain, oilcake, meal, vitamins, mineral additives, etc.), balanced in nutrients to provide a complete diet for farm animals, poultry, and fish. The products of such factories are used in animal husbandry to improve animal productivity and health.
Specialized grain storage facilities
Specialized grain storage facilities for certain types of grain, such as rice elevators or oilseed elevators, are designed to meet the specific storage requirements of each type of product.

Elevator selection criteria
When deciding whether to purchase or build an elevator, it is important to carefully consider a number of important factors to ensure that your investment is effective and that your choice is tailored to the specific needs of your business.
Capacity and storage volumes
Capacity and storage volumes are among the key parameters when constructing grain elevators. Elevators vary in capacity from several hundred tons to hundreds of thousands of tons. The capacity should be selected taking into account both the current and projected volumes of your grain production. For example, an elevator with a capacity of 5,000–10,000 tons may be suitable for medium-sized farms, while large agro-industrial complexes may require facilities with a capacity of 50,000 tons or more.
Grain type
Grain type — grain crops have different storage requirements. For example, wheat and rye require different conditions than corn and sunflowers. It is important that the elevator design provides for the necessary ventilation, temperature, and humidity parameters.
Storage conditions
Storage conditions — modern elevators are equipped with climate control systems that maintain optimal conditions for each type of grain. The systems must be adapted to prevent mold and rot, as well as to protect against pests.
Budget
Budget — the construction of an elevator requires significant capital investment. However, it is not worth skimping on quality, as this will affect the safety of your harvest and, consequently, the profitability of your business. It is important to consider not only the initial costs of turnkey elevator construction, but also the long-term costs of operation and maintenance.
Technology and equipment
A modern elevator is a high-tech complex that includes automation, accounting, grain quality control, and safety systems. The choice of technology should be tailored to the specifics of your operations and aimed at improving the efficiency of grain storage and handling.
Location
Location — the distance to major logistics hubs and roads also plays an important role. The elevator should be conveniently located in relation to the fields where the grain is grown, as well as to points of sale or processing.
Supplier reliability
Supplier reliability — when choosing a company to build your elevator, pay attention to its reputation, experience in the field, and reviews from other customers. It is important that the equipment supplier provides a full range of services, from design to installation and maintenance.

Choosing an elevator
Choosing an elevator is a big deal that needs a lot of thought and consideration. The right equipment will not only keep your harvest safe and sound, but also make your whole agribusiness more efficient.
Steps in building an elevator
Elevator construction is a multi-stage process that requires detailed planning and consistent execution. The initial stage includes design, which is based on an analysis of the customer's needs, the location where the elevator will be located, and technical capabilities. Many factors are taken into account, from the estimated capacity and type of grain to be stored to the logistics routes for grain delivery and shipment. Once the design has been approved, the construction site preparation stage begins. At this stage, earthworks are carried out, the foundation is laid, and utilities are installed. This is followed by the construction of the elevator itself: silos for grain storage, mechanisms for lifting and transporting grain, ventilation and drying systems.
Elevator installation
The installation of elevators is a significant stage. It is important that all elements of the system work as a single unit, ensuring reliable and uninterrupted operation. At this stage, training is also provided for the personnel who will be working on the elevator.
Final stage
The final stage is the commissioning of the facility, which includes obtaining all necessary permits and certificates confirming the elevator's compliance with applicable norms and standards. After that, the elevator can begin full operation.
Technical equipment of the elevator
The technical equipment of the elevator must meet modern efficiency and safety requirements. The main elements are loading systems, which may include conveyors and bucket elevators designed to lift grain to the required height.
Grain drying system
The grain drying system is a critical component that prepares the harvest for long-term storage by reducing its moisture content to a safe level. Modern dryers are equipped with sensors and automation that control the drying process and prevent overheating or overdrying of the grain.
Grain cleaning systems
Grain cleaning systems remove impurities from the crop, improving its quality and value. They can be equipped with vibrating screens, magnetic separators, and other devices for effective cleaning.

Commissioning:
• start-up and adjustment (automation, boiler room, central heating); • comprehensive testing, commissioning (signing of the acceptance certificate for the completed facility).
Commissioning:
Warranty period - 1 year, unless otherwise specified in the contract.
Industrial greenhouses — high efficiency and quality
For a large complex of industrial greenhouses with heating, a boiler room, substation, warehouses, garages, cold rooms, an administration building, and other facilities are being built. All this allows for continuous operation and constant monitoring of the condition of the greenhouses in one place. Therefore, when creating such a complex, it is necessary to carefully consider the logistics of all the necessary processes, which will save time and avoid mistakes in the future.
Tunnel and block industrial greenhouses
Tunnel structures are ideal for agricultural enterprises and farms growing crops in closed ground. Block structures are suitable for use on flat sites in different climatic zones. This greenhouse can be operated all year round with heating.
