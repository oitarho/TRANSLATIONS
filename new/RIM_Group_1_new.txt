Delivery to the site is carried out by standard freight transport without additional costs, 
because during manufacturing we immediately plan solutions that will allow us to deliver the 
modules to the installation site.

STAGE 5

INSTALLATION OF A MODULAR HOUSE

The installation of a modular house takes up to 24 hours, including connection of all engineering systems and inspection. 
Everything is carried out with a minimum set of equipment and installers.  
After installation, the house is completely ready for living. 
Materials and solutions allow it to operate as a full-fledged capital structure. 
Service life up to 50 years, earthquake resistance up to 9 points. 
The solutions that we apply allow us to make the house not only autonomous, 
but also "smart" through the use of remote control.
