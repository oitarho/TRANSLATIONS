The result of engineering and surveying is a detailed plan (survey) with the current terrain relief, plot boundaries, and all existing buildings marked. Engineering and geological surveys allow you to assess the possibility of constructing a building, taking into account the characteristics of the soil. A special set of works is aimed at studying the physical composition of the soil and assessing the stability of the site to determine the type of foundation. The RIM GROUP team of engineers will help you resolve any issues related to conducting surveys: they will advise you on the composition and stages of each type of engineering survey, prepare accompanying documentation, and organize state expert review.
The design of your future home is carried out by a team of specialists from the RIMG GROUP architecture and design bureau.

3. Column foundation
For country houses, it is recommended to install a column foundation with a grillage. This is a monolithic slab or frame that connects the columns at the top, giving the structure greater strength and rigidity.
4. Driven piles
A reinforced concrete driven foundation is a reliable base for heavy structures that place a large load on the soil. Reinforced concrete piles for foundations are rods with a square or round cross-section and a pointed lower end. The most common are square piles with a side length of 200 to 400 mm and a length of 3 to 28 m.
5. Shell piles
Shell piles are hollow piles ranging in size from 800 to 1600 mm, made of reinforced concrete, which may have a tip. Thanks to their large contact area between the walls and the soil layers, shell piles provide a high degree of stability.
They are used for building foundations on weak soils, in earthquake-prone regions, in conditions of increased pushing and pulling loads, and for the construction of bridges and overpasses.






12страница

6. Strip foundation
A monolithic strip foundation is a reinforced concrete contour arranged under all load-bearing walls of a building under construction, which allows the entire load of the building to be transferred evenly to the ground. Strip foundations are the most common and cheapest type of foundation for capital buildings.
7. Screw piles
A screw pile is a foundation for a house made of steel piles that are screwed into the ground and connected by a grillage. A screw pile is an element of a quick-to-build foundation that can be driven into almost any soil. Such piles are made of steel pipes of various diameters with special blades for screwing into the ground either manually or with special machines (steel thickness not less than 3 mm, blades not less than 4 mm).
8. Drilled piles
Drilled piles are a type of support used for installing foundations. To install a support post, a hole is drilled, a casing pipe and a reinforced frame are lowered into it, and concrete is poured in.

1. Base

The base is a structural element of a building located between the foundation and the walls of the first floor. It is needed, in particular, to protect the building from moisture and cold. For this reason, it is additionally covered with insulation and protected from moisture with waterproofing materials. The junction between the plinth and the walls and floor of the first floor must be well protected from external influences. Waterproofing and thermal insulation prevent sediment and soil moisture from penetrating the building material and also prevent condensation from forming. The presence of a basement also protects the interior from the cold and allows you to comfortably survive even very cold winters.

2. Basement
The basement is an accessible room used for temporary or permanent habitation, with a floor level below the ground level around the building. The height of the basement must not be less than 2.5 meters (to be considered a floor), and it can rise no more than one meter above the ground.

3. Security room
A security room is a reinforced room installed in a private home or business to provide a safe haven for life or a secluded place for residents in the event of a break-in or intrusion into the home.

9. Plaster
Levelling plaster is used on uneven walls with large differences in height. It can be applied in a thick layer. It usually has a high grain size. After it is applied, a layer of finishing plaster must be applied.
Basic plaster is standard and is applied to smooth walls before further finishing, such as wallpapering or tiling.
Finishing plaster is applied in a thin layer at the end of wall preparation. It has a fine grain and creates a smooth base for further finishing. It cannot hide large defects.
9.1. Decorative plaster
Decorative plaster is an alternative to wallpaper, painting, and other finishing options. It can be used both inside and outside buildings. There are many options for application and texture creation. At the same time, it is not necessary to level the base to perfection. Decorative plaster is applied to the base and also hides minor defects. After hardening, the surface becomes durable, wear-resistant, and moisture-resistant. It is a simple yet reliable option for finishing walls.

TRIGENERATION SYSTEMS
Trigeneration is the simultaneous generation of three types of energy: electricity, heat, ventilation, and cooling. Trigeneration is a process in which part of the thermal energy produced by a gas piston unit is used to generate cooling, which is used for the technological needs of the enterprise and for air conditioning.
KU SERIES COGENERATION UNITS
A cogeneration plant uses a primary energy source — gas — to produce two forms of energy: heat and electricity. The main advantage of a cogeneration power plant over conventional power plants is that energy conversion is more efficient. In other words, a cogeneration plant allows the use of heat that is normally lost. Fuel consumption is significantly reduced.
POWER PLANTS FROM 8.8 KW TO 2500 KW
Diesel and gas generator sets are designed for use as the main source of electricity when centralized power supply is unavailable or as emergency power supply equipment in organizations that require a constant, uninterrupted source of electricity.
Power lines
A power line is an extended structure consisting of wires, cables, supports, insulators, and auxiliary devices. Power lines are designed to transmit or distribute electrical energy from power plants to substations and consumers, as well as to connect adjacent power systems. Depending on their design, power lines are classified as: — overhead lines, whose wires are suspended above the ground or above water; — underground (submarine) power lines, which mainly use power cables.

WIND TURBINE A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of wind flow into mechanical energy of rotor rotation, which is then converted into electrical energy. Wind turbines can be divided into three categories: industrial, commercial, and domestic (for private use). Industrial wind turbines are installed by the government or large energy corporations. They are usually connected to a network, resulting in a wind farm.
SUPER-EFFICIENT SPHERICAL SOLAR CELLS
In diffused light, a spherical photovoltaic cell generated approximately 60% more energy than a flat one. The sphere consists of monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, which are the most common in the modern solar energy industry. Scientists chose them deliberately because they wanted to simplify and reduce the cost of the manufacturing process as much as possible.
V3SOLAR - ROTATING SOLAR BATTERIES
V3Solar - rotating solar batteries are 20 times more efficient than flat ones. The most common type of solar panel is the flat panel, and although there are mechanisms that tilt them at the right angle to track the sun's movement, there are certain limitations associated with significantly increasing the efficiency of this basic design.
TESLA SOLAR PANELS
Tesla solar panels are designed to be highly efficient and provide maximum solar energy production year-round, even on roofs with complex angles. Your integrated system, powered by the Tesla Solar Inverter, is safe and reliable.

ELECTRICAL PANELS The electricity that powers residential buildings, public buildings, and industrial enterprises must be supplied to the facilities in accordance with all rules and technical regulations. Firstly, electricity must be supplied to appliances without interruption, and secondly, it must be safe and protect the home from short circuits. For these purposes, distribution boards are used — devices designed to receive and distribute electricity to end users.
CABLE, WIRE
Cables are necessary to supply electricity from the source to the equipment, i.e., to connect various devices to the power grid. A wire is a single insulated conductor. The insulation may be covered with a non-metallic sheath, winding, or braiding. It is also used to connect electrical equipment to a power source.
LOW-VOLTAGE EQUIPMENT
Devices operating in a voltage range not exceeding 1000 volts DC or 1500 volts AC. These include automatic circuit breakers, differential circuit breakers, protective relays, control and measuring instruments, power transformers and voltage stabilizers, low-voltage electric motors and drives.
HOUSEHOLD SOCKETS, SWITCHES WITH AND WITHOUT WI-FI.
Stylish and smart sockets can replace standard sockets and switches in a room. A 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network is required for full operation. Designed for remote control of 220 V electrical appliances using a smartphone with an app. Manual control via a button on the body is also provided. The app menu displays a graphical indication of the power on/off status. There is also an LED indicator on the body to determine the status of the socket or switch.

CENTRAL GAS SUPPLY FOR A PRIVATE HOUSE
“Connection point” - the point of connection between the contractor's gas distribution network and the gas consumption network of the capital construction project; ‘actual connection’ - a set of technical measures ensuring the physical connection (contact) of the contractor's facilities and the applicant's facilities with the supply of gas to the applicant's facilities.
AUTONOMOUS GAS SUPPLY SYSTEM
An autonomous gas supply system is a completely independent fuel supply system that uses liquefied hydrocarbon gas as fuel. When using it, the consumer has the opportunity to be completely independent from central communications - heating, gas supply, hot water supply, and even electricity supply.
GAS REGULATION POINT
Gas regulation points (GRPs) are a set of technological equipment and devices designed to reduce the inlet gas pressure to a specified level and maintain it at the outlet regardless of the gas flow rate.
LIQUEFIED GAS EVAPORATOR
The liquid phase of LPG from the tank enters the heat exchanger, which is heated by electric heaters through an intermediate heat transfer fluid — antifreeze with an anti-corrosion additive. The liquid phase evaporates in the heat exchanger. The vapors exit the gas chamber through a system that prevents the liquid phase from entering the outlet tract, which has a float valve that operates without electricity or pilot air. The protection system is activated when the gas consumption of the equipment exceeds the evaporator capacity or when the electric heaters fail and the heat transfer fluid stops heating.

CENTRALIZED COLD WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM
A centralized system is a water supply system in which water from one or more sources is fed into a common water distribution network or first into one or more reservoirs, and from there into a common network that supplies water to the entire facility served by the system. In this case, all consumers are supplied with water from a single water supply system. Water intake, pumping, and treatment facilities are designed to supply water to all consumers within the system's coverage area and operate according to an agreed schedule.
AUTONOMOUS WATER SUPPLY
Autonomous water supply for a private house allows for the uninterrupted withdrawal of drinking water from an underground source regardless of the condition of the central system. The consumption rates, supply schedule, and conditions of use are determined by the owner.
COLD WATER SUPPLY CONTROL CABINET (CWS)
The cold water supply control cabinet (SHU HVS) is part of the cold water supply control system in industrial and residential buildings. In turn, the HVS system can be part of a central heating unit or an individual heating unit (CTP or ITP). The use of cold water supply control cabinets significantly improves the operational and economic characteristics of the cold water supply system of buildings as a whole.
PIPES
Domestic and drinking water pipes are part of the municipal and domestic main pipeline system. It is designed to supply water directly to consumers for domestic and drinking purposes. This is a type of internal water supply system in a house and belongs to the class of cold water supply systems. It is considered the most important part of the main pipeline system, as it provides the population of our large country with a vital resource — clean water.

RADIATORS
A heating radiator is a convective-radiative heating device consisting of separate, usually columnar elements—sections—with internal channels through which a heat transfer fluid circulates. Heat from the radiator is transferred by radiation, convection, and thermal conduction.
WATER HEATING SYSTEMS
The main part of a water heating system is a boiler (gas, solid fuel, liquid fuel), furnace, or electric heater. There are multi-fuel and universal models that can use different types of fuel, such as gas and diesel. Water circuits can be single-pipe or double-pipe. In double-pipe systems, the heat transfer fluid is supplied to the heating devices through one pipe and returns through another. In this case, the water temperature does not depend on the number of radiators and only decreases slightly as it passes through the pipe, which has virtually no effect on the efficiency of heating. In such systems, water supply can be forced or natural.
AIR HEATING IN A PRIVATE HOUSE
This type includes gas and electric convectors and various types of stoves. These devices do not have a heat transfer medium, and the air in the room is heated directly from them. These types of heating systems heat the room through air convection. This happens as follows: cold air flows through the louvers and hot plates of the device, heats up, and enters the room. The devices may have a fan that forces the air to circulate.
ELECTRIC HEATING SYSTEMS
Electric boilers are used to heat houses and apartments. Electric heating is a complex of devices designed to heat a room using electricity (electric boilers, underfloor heating, household electric heaters, and other products). The advantage of this method is its accessibility, reliability, and high efficiency.

RECOUPERATOR The main function of the recuperator is to obtain useful energy from the air removed from the room. This function is supplemented by the condition that the flows must not mix, i.e. the supply air must not be significantly contaminated by the exhaust air. In ventilation and air conditioning systems, this type of energy recovery is relevant in both winter and summer.
KITCHEN EXHAUST A kitchen exhaust is a device for cleaning the air of smoke, combustion products, vapors, odors, and other unwanted impurities that are generated during the heat treatment of food and accumulate in the kitchen.
SENSOR PANEL CONTROLLERS A panel controller is a human-machine interface device that combines an operator panel with a programmable logic controller in a single housing.

CHILLERS
A chiller is a refrigeration unit used for air conditioning in industrial-scale indoor spaces. It is capable of maintaining a temperature level that ensures the continuous operation of production equipment. The most widespread type of chiller is the chiller-fan coil system. It owes its popularity to its ability to regulate the microclimate in two separate rooms at once.
WET COOLING TOWER
A cooling tower is a special device designed to cool water with atmospheric air. Industrial cooling towers are the most economical and efficient way to cool large volumes of water and various liquids, as they do not use ammonia, freon, or other substances involved in heat exchange, which require additional electricity.
SPLIT SYSTEMS
Both split systems and air conditioners can be considered synonymous devices, but the range of air conditioner models is much wider and includes mobile or window monoblocks. Once upon a time, bulky window air conditioners were widespread, but they did not provide the desired coolness. The advent of the aesthetically pleasing split system was an innovative breakthrough, and its division into a noisy external unit and a quiet and elegant internal unit saved space inside the room. Therefore, any split system is an air conditioner, but not every air conditioner is a split system.

REMOVAL OF MECHANICAL IMPURITIES
The water treatment system for a private house in this case consists of several stages: the first stage involves placing a layer of granular filler at the bottom of the well (borehole); the next stage involves installing a intake screen to prevent damage to the pump; the main production filter is created from a tank filled with sand; in the subsequent stages of the process, mud traps, disc structures, and specialized cartridges are used.
IRON AND MANGANESE REMOVAL
The scheme for removing iron from well water is developed after determining the form of impurities: organic components are treated with special reagents (ozone, sodium hypochlorite); colloids are agglomerated by coagulation; divalent iron is converted into an insoluble state by oxidation for subsequent retention of particles by a mechanical filter.
HARDNESS AND LIME REMOVAL
A typical water treatment system for a country house requires reliable protection against scale. To solve this problem, the following methods are used: treatment with polyphosphates; transformation of salt impurities with a strong magnetic field; ion exchange; membrane purification.
NITRATE REMOVAL
This term refers to salt compounds of nitric acid, which are often used to improve crop yields. These contaminants are present in open water bodies, wells, and sand wells. Experts emphasize the particular danger of the sequential conversion of fertilizers in this category into nitrites and nitrosamines. The increased toxicity of chemical compounds can significantly worsen health, even leading to death. According to SanPin standards, the maximum concentration of nitrates is limited to 45 mg per liter.

A centralized sewage system is a complex of engineering structures in populated areas for the collection, treatment, and discharge of wastewater into water bodies and the treatment of wastewater sludge. Street sewerage network is a network of pipelines laid along streets, driveways, alleys, embankments, and other thoroughfares of a populated area, including the length of collecting collectors, but excluding main collectors.
CLOSED STORM WATER DRAINAGE SYSTEM
A closed storm sewer system is a system of underground engineering communications designed to drain atmospheric precipitation from the roofs of buildings, hard-surfaced areas, or flood-prone areas. The installation of a closed storm sewer system usually requires preliminary planning and calculations and is accompanied by a series of labor-intensive earthworks.
OPEN/OUTDOOR STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM
This type of storm drain consists of drainage gutters in the pavement, through which water flows to a specific location or is discharged into a garden/vegetable garden. This type of storm drain consists of trays and channels that are not buried in the ground. It is also necessary to install rainwater collection and collector wells, in which the liquid settles before entering the centralized sewerage system.
MIXED
Part of the storm sewer is built in the ground, and part is above ground. This is the optimal option in terms of cost, appearance, and the amount of resources required. What you definitely need to do is divert water away from the house. This can be done by installing gutters in the driveway and draining the water onto the lawn.

TRIGENERATION BY REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEM (RAM) FROM MWM
Trigeneration (CCHP - combined cooling, heat, and power) is the process of simultaneously generating electricity, heat, and cooling. A trigeneration complex is a combination of a cogeneration unit (which generates electricity and heat) with an absorption chiller that produces cold by consuming the heat generated and a small amount of electricity. The MWM Remote Monitoring (RAM) digital system allows the technical condition of the facility to be diagnosed from anywhere in the world in real time, enabling a timely response to any changes.
REMOTE MONITORING OF COGENERATION SYSTEMS
Nowadays, online access to cogeneration plant management via the Internet is no longer a problem. MWM relies on modern VPN channels, as this is more convenient for the customer than access via a modem. The user can set up wireless mobile data transmission independently.
Remote access to power plant equipment management via the Internet is an integral part of MWM's modern service concept. This type of remote service and diagnostics is not entirely new, but it has undergone several stages of technical improvement in recent years.
POWER PLANTS FROM 8.8 KW TO 2500 KW WITH REMOTE MONITORING AND CONTROL VIA GSM CHANNEL
Diesel and gas generator sets are designed for use as the main source of electricity when centralized power supply is unavailable or as emergency power supply equipment in organizations that require a constant, uninterrupted source of electricity.

MONITORING AND CONTROL VIA GSM CHANNEL
Monitoring and control via GSM channel is a technology that uses cellular communication to transfer data between a diesel power plant and an operator's computer/controller. The connection between the unit and the computer is established via a GSM modem connected to the RS232 port. To ensure high-quality communication and data transfer, the “data transfer” (CSD) function must be enabled. Two SIM cards must be installed for this technology to work: one at the facility and one with the operator. This ensures constant communication between the diesel power station and the operator in real time. One of the advantages of using GSM monitoring and control technology is the ability to receive information about the status of the DES systems not only on the operator's computer, but also in the form of SMS messages to a selected phone number.

REMOTE-CONTROLLED WIND TURBINES
A wind turbine is a device that converts wind energy into electrical energy or mechanical energy to drive mechanical devices (such as a water pump). The ancestors of modern wind turbines were windmills, and with the development of technology and the advent of the electrical age, windmills were no longer just used to grind grain into flour or pump water, but also to rotate generators that produced electricity.
INNOVATIVE VERTICAL WIND TURBINES
A distinctive feature of vertical wind turbines is their high-resistance concave side, which transfers the force of the wind directly to the rotor shaft, which is connected directly to a generator that converts energy into electricity. The resistance force is controllable, and the torque of the turbine can be adjusted by increasing the size of the blades and the distance between them.
CONTROL AND MONITORING
The wind turbine generates energy that is transmitted to a substation and then distributed. On the other hand, everything is controlled remotely via a wind turbine controller connected to the TRB145, a small but powerful 4G LTE serial gateway from Teltonika Networks. This device provides a reliable and stable internet connection and acts as a Modbus gateway between the controller and the control center, where all monitoring and control takes place. The TRB145 industrial gateway is the ideal choice not only because it is equipped with a Serial RS485 interface with Modbus RTU, but also because it is based on RutOS and equipped with advanced features such as OpenVPN, Firewall, IPsec, and more. In addition, this gateway can be managed and monitored via RMS, a remote management system.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL AIR QUALITY MONITOR WITH CO2 SENSOR, WEATHER STATION, SMART VENTILATION VAKIO ATMOSPHERE
Weakness, fatigue, drowsiness, headaches—all of these can be the result of elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the room. The VAKIO ATMOSPHERE air quality monitor is a climate device for measuring temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels. The monitor then transmits this data to other devices responsible for the indoor air quality (e.g., VAKIO Window Smart, Base Smart, OpenAir), thereby maintaining the cleanliness and temperature of the indoor air without your intervention!

Smart home cooling is a system that controls the cooling process in a room using modern technology and smart devices.

FIRE STOP KIT
The fire alarm kit is designed to prevent smoke, fires, and explosions caused by household gas. The brain of the entire kit is the fire alarm controller. It is an electronic device with a processor and smart firmware inside, just like a smartphone. Up to 30 sensors of different types can be connected to it wirelessly. These can be standard radio sensors for household gas, carbon monoxide, and smoke, operating at a frequency of 433 MHz. If your home is gasified, then at the first signs of trouble—smoke, carbon monoxide, or gas in the air—you must quickly shut off the gas supply to the home and completely disconnect it from the power supply. This will be done by the Stop-Beda controller, which will receive a danger signal from one of the sensors and send a command to one or two “mechanical arm” manipulators. These, in turn, will shut off the gas, and the system can turn off the electric stove. For this purpose, we recommend purchasing a Stop-Beda internet gateway or an alarm system with internet access together with the Stop-Fire device. Not only will they activate a very loud siren in case of an alarm, but they will also notify the owner via push notification, SMS, and phone call. They can also call the fire department.
WI-FI SMOKE DETECTOR, TUYA FIRE SAFETY SYSTEM
1. The smoke detector detects a fire in its early stages and generates a warning signal, allowing the owner to quickly extinguish the fire and protect the room from the effects of fire. 2. The model is equipped with a WiFi module that allows you to integrate it into a smart home system, include it in automation scenarios, and receive notifications on your phone when connected to the Internet. 3. Can be used without a network connection, in which case the device will simply beep loudly and flash an indicator when smoke is detected.

Smart water purification is a water treatment system equipped with modern technologies and features that enable effective removal of contaminants from water, making it safe for drinking and other uses. Such systems often have the ability to monitor water quality, automatically adjust the purification process, and be controlled via a smartphone or other devices. These systems are also generally more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional water purification methods.
XIAOMI WATER PURIFIER 600G (MR652-B)
With the Mi Home app, you can monitor the filter status, view information about the quality of the incoming and outgoing water, water consumption, and other data. 6 levels of filtration The six-stage purification system includes 2 filters — a PPC composite filter and a RO 600H reverse osmosis filter. The composite filter removes large impurities, rust, and residual chlorine from the water, prevents sediment from forming on the reverse osmosis filter, and extends its service life. The RO filter provides high-precision filtration of particles as small as 0.0001 microns, removing harmful substances, viruses, bacteria, heavy metals, antibiotics, and organic substances from the water. Its service life is 3 years. Performance The ratio of waste water to clean water is 2:1, with a performance of up to 68.5%. The clean water flow rate of 1.58 L/min allows you to fill a 150 ml glass with water in just 5.7 seconds.

house kit options
It is characteristic that each detail of the house kit made at the factory is marked with a specific serial number for convenience. These numbers are used in the drawing to make it clear where, how, and in what sequence to assemble. The walls made of SIP panels are quite light and thin, so the entire house kit can be delivered in one trip if the area of the house does not exceed 200 square meters. Since this is a ready-made kit, this eliminates the unpleasant need to purchase additional building materials during the construction process.
