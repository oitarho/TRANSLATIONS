The Council facilitates collaboration between the FACTORY’s specialists and institutions such as the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), Grozny State Oil Technical University named after M.D. Millionshchikov (GGNTU), and the Kucherenko Central Research Institute for Building Structures (TSNIIKS).The company "TEPLOSTROYPROYEKT-S" includes a training center (supervised by the Scientific Council), which regularly conducts educational seminars and supports the integration of new technologies. This collaborative experience between leading national research laboratories and production experts is not only unique in itself but also notable for involving students in the process.

Participation in internships allows students to gain hands-on experience on real projects—from concept to realization (project documentation, economic and technical justification)—under the guidance of the company's seasoned professionals. This is precisely why Rim Group founded its own student academy.

By combining theory and practice, we shape the future.
The Rim Group Academy is a joint project with the Grozny State Oil Technical University named after Millionshchikov. It is aimed at providing university students with practical training at the company’s manufacturing facilities. We understand that applying theoretical knowledge in practice is essential—and that is exactly what the Rim Group Academy offers.As part of the project, a modern classroom was opened in the main building of GGNTU to familiarize students with Rim Group's activities and accept applications for internships. Our team of specialists and professionals is excited to share our innovative approaches in industrial, civil, and modular construction.

4.1. Industrial Facilities

Industrial facilities are enterprises and structures designed to produce
goods or provide services of an industrial nature. These include FACTORYs, factories,
power FACTORYs, oil refineries, mining enterprises, and other similar
facilities. A characteristic feature is the use of sophisticated technological equipment and
infrastructure for processing raw materials, materials and energy. Industrial facilities vary
in scale, type of production, and degree of automation. Their activities have a significant impact on
the impact on the economy and the environment, therefore, safety and environmental friendliness are
the most important aspects of their functioning.

4.2. Civil Facilities

Civilian facilities are buildings and structures intended for non–military use.
These are residential buildings, schools, hospitals, shops, office buildings, cultural centers and much more. They
ensure the vital activity of the population and the functioning of the social sphere. The safety
and comfort of citizens is a priority in the design and operation of such facilities. The variety
of functions and architectural solutions determines their diversity.

============================================================================================

4.3. Agricultural Facilities
Agricultural facilities are buildings, structures, and land plots used for
the production of agricultural products. This includes fields, farms, greenhouses, livestock
complexes, storage facilities, and processing FACTORYs. Their purpose is to grow FACTORYs, breed
animals, and obtain food and raw materials. Modern agricultural facilities often
use automation, innovative technologies and respect for the environment
to increase efficiency and yield.

4.4. Renovation, reconstruction, and modernization – transition from old to “Smart”

before after

Renovation, reconstruction and modernization are the renovation of real estate, turning
the "old" into modern and "smart". Renovation is a comprehensive renovation, reconstruction is a change
in structure and functionality, modernization is an improvement of individual systems. Smart renovation
involves the integration of modern technologies: smart homes, automation, energy efficiency,
and digital services. As a result, outdated buildings become functional, comfortable,
safe and environmentally friendly, increasing their value and efficiency.

* During production: parts are fitted in welded joints, hole alignments are checked, fixators are installed, and individual markings are applied.
* The parameters and size of the equipment allow for the assembly and final check of large-sized structures. This is a mandatory step where the accuracy of setup jigs and geometric dimensions is verified.

STAGE 7

Shot blasting chamber for cleaning structures

Final cleaning is carried out in the paint and loading shop: degreasing of areas contaminated with oils and lubricants, followed by a second round of shot blasting. The workshop is equipped with:

* a manual shot blasting chamber;
* an automatic shot blasting unit. This equipment allows for quick and high-quality surface preparation of the metal.

============================================================================================

STAGE 8

PAINTING SHOP

After assembly and cleaning, the structures undergo anti-corrosion treatment, painting, and drying. The FACTORY's technical equipment allows for both air and airless spray application of coatings. We use materials from leading manufacturers.

* Painting and drying are performed on racks and in drying chambers.
* The latest painting equipment is used for coating and priming.

============================================================================================

Factory. Production Stages

STAGE 9 

QUALITY CONTROL

The application of coatings is checked using thickness gauges and adhesion quality control systems.

* The FACTORY is equipped with modern devices: coating thickness gauges, profilometers, and adhesion testers.
* Quality control is carried out at all stages of production. For this purpose, there is a technical control department and its own laboratory.
* Welding seams are inspected using non-destructive methods – ultrasonic (ultrasonic flaw detection, ultrasonic thickness measurement), radiation (X-ray), visual inspection, as well as destructive testing methods (on samples).

ASSEMBLY

The assembly of the modular house takes up to 24 hours, including the connection of all engineering systems and testing. This is done with a minimal set of equipment and installers. After installation, the house is fully ready for habitation. The materials and solutions used ensure that it operates as a fully functional permanent structure. The service life of the building is up to 50 years, and its seismic resistance is up to 9 points. The solutions we apply make the house not only autonomous but also "smart" through the use of remote control.
