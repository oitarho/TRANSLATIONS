Types of bridges






45 ��������
ARCH BRIDGES
An arch bridge is a bridge with spans whose main load-bearing structures are arches or vaults. The characteristic features of arch bridges are the transmission of not only vertical but also horizontal forces (spacing) to the supports, and the arches (vaults) work mainly in compression. Arched bridges are usually built with driving on top, they are characterized by lightweight construction and architectural expressiveness.





46 ��������
CABLE-STAYED BRIDGES
The construction of cable-stayed bridges is usually done in a cantilevered manner. After the tower is built, one cable and a section of deck is built in each direction. Each deck section is prestressed before continuing. The process is repeated until the deck sections meet in the middle where they are joined. The ends are secured to the supports.





47 ��������
GIRDER BRIDGES
steel girders hold the roadway and divide it into spans. The versatility of the structures makes it possible to build bridges in any terrain: in mountainous areas, across rivers with constant navigation. Girder bridges are the most common in modern bridge construction, they are built of steel, steel-reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete and laminated timber.




48 ��������
PEDESTRIAN BRIDGES

Vladikavkaz

Volgograd

Grozny, Chechen Republic
A pedestrian bridge is a bridge designed exclusively for pedestrians. Depending on the features of the obstacles crossed, pedestrian bridges are divided into three types: -Pedestrian bridges over water obstacles. -Bridges over highways, streets, or railroad tracks. Such bridges are located near settlements or railroad stations. -City pedestrian bridges.
